# the-undercover-NodeJS-Express-back-end-server

### Deployment
The app is currently deployed in "https://adaptable.io/". \\
For the deployment, make sure to delete the node_modules foder and just do a push to master for the deployment to trigger. \\

### Endpoint to test
Get All Players: [https://adaptable.io/](https://back-express.adaptable.app/api/players)https://back-express.adaptable.app/api/players \\
Get Player by username: [https://adaptable.io/](https://back-express.adaptable.app/api/players/Gnizar) https://back-express.adaptable.app/api/players/Gnizar \\
If these don't work there is probably an issue with the app. You can Init the app back by taking what exists in the other repo: the-undercover-game, or it might a problem with the db config.
